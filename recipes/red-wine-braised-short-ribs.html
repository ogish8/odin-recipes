    <h2>Recipe Description</h2>
    <p>
        Red wine braised short ribs are a luxurious and comforting dish featuring tender beef ribs that have been slow-cooked to perfection. 
        The ribs are first seared to develop a rich, caramelized crust, then braised in a robust mixture of red wine, beef broth, and aromatic vegetables such as onions, carrots, garlic, and celery. 
        As they simmer slowly in the oven, the meat absorbs the deep flavors of the wine and herbs, becoming melt-in-your-mouth tender.
        The braising liquid reduces into a rich, velvety sauce that coats the ribs, adding layers of complexity with hints of sweetness, acidity, and savory depth. Served over creamy mashed potatoes, polenta, or alongside crusty bread, this dish is a hearty and elegant option perfect for special occasions or a cozy dinner.

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat oven to 350°. Season short ribs with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high. 
            Working in 2 batches, brown short ribs on all sides, about 8 minutes per batch. Transfer short ribs to a plate. Pour off all but 3 Tbsp. drippings from pot.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add onions, carrots, and celery to pot and cook over medium-high heat, stirring often, until onions are browned, about 5 minutes. 
            Add flour and tomato paste; cook, stirring constantly, until well combined and deep red, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in wine, then add short ribs with any accumulated juices. 
            Bring to a boil; lower heat to medium and simmer until wine is reduced by half, about 25 minutes. Add all herbs to pot along with garlic. Stir in stock. Bring to a boil, cover, and transfer to oven.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook until short ribs are tender, 2 to 2½ hours. Transfer short ribs to a platter. Strain sauce from pot into a measuring cup. 
            Spoon fat from surface of sauce and discard; season sauce to taste with salt and pepper. Serve in shallow bowls over mashed potatoes with sauce spooned over. 
        </li>
    </ol>
