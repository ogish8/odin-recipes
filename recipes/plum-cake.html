    <h2>Recipe Description</h2>
    <p>
        A plum cake is a rich, dense cake traditionally made with a variety of dried fruits such as raisins, currants, prunes, and dates, often soaked in alcohol like rum or brandy for added depth of flavor.
        Despite its name, modern plum cakes typically do not contain fresh plums but are inspired by old recipes where "plum" referred to dried fruits. The batter is spiced with warm spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves, giving it a fragrant aroma, and often includes nuts like almonds or walnuts for added texture. 
        With a golden-brown crust and a dark, fruit-studded interior, each bite offers a burst of sweet and tangy fruit flavors balanced by the warmth of spices and the cake's richness. Often baked during the holiday season, plum cakes are enjoyed as a celebratory dessert and improve with age, making them ideal for baking ahead of time.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon lemon zest</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups plums, pitted and quartered</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9-inch tube pan.</li>
        <li>Separate eggs into whites and yolks. Beat egg whites until stiff peaks form; set aside.</li>
        <li>Beat butter and sugar together in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Beat in egg yolks and lemon zest.</li>
        <li>Stir flour and baking powder together, then blend into butter mixture. Gently fold in egg whites. Spread cake batter evenly into the prepared pan. There will only be a little over an inch of batter. Arrange plums, skin-side down, in a nice pattern over the batter.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven until a tester inserted in the center comes out clean, about 40 minutes. Transfer to a cooling rack and allow to cool before serving.</li>
    </ol>
